# List of Projects
This is a list of projects I made. Some of them have been commissioned, and as a result, I am unable to share the source code. For the few of them that are not currently live, I have attached images.


## YouTestPlus
* Live website: Not live since I only made part of the website
* Source code: Not public
* Technologies: Docker, Nginx, PayloadCMS, NextJS, Redux, MongoDB, TailwindCSS
* Images: [Link](https://github.com/github-luciano/CV/tree/main/youtestplus).
> Note: The images are sourced from design files, not from the live website.

I have been part of the YouTestPlus team for about 10 months. My main task was make a web app that would meet the needs of the company. The work I've done includes the following: 

* Assess and define the technological requirements and services for the company's operations.
* Select a technology stack that aligns with the organization's needs.
* Develop the web app.
* Attend meetings.
* Discuss and suggest ideas for new products.

### Features
I developed the following features into the web app:
* User authentication.
* Settings page for users that would allow to edit personal details.
* Simulations.
* Simulations history.
* On-demand video lessons system.
* Shop interface.
* Dashboard.

For all the features mentioned above, the web app has admin panels that would allow to edit everything. The admin panels were generated with PayloadCMS.

## Primal Members
Note: The live website will take a while to load since it's on a free tier hosting.

* Live website: https://express-members-only-xp15.onrender.com/
* Source code: https://github.com/github-luciano/express-members-only
* Technologies: ExpressJS, PugJS, PassportJS, MongoDB, SCSS
* Project overview: Learning authentication.

This website was made as a project to learn authentication in ExpressJS using PassportJS. The scope of the project was to make a talk-board that only website members had access to. You can login using credentials `admin admin`. After login, to get a membership you should go to `Membership` from the header menu to get a membership. In the Talk-Board, only members can see the usernames of people who posted, and only members can post a comment. Additionally, I added a Shop that will give discounts to members.

As for access control, only admins are allowed to delete posts from the Talk-Board. The user is prompted with `Are you an admin?` during the signup process.

## Fragrance Library
